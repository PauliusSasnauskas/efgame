# EFGAME
This is a turn-based multiplater strategy game written in javascript.
Wrote this in the summer of 2018.
Might get updated soon.
Consists of: Client and Server

### Client
Current state: compiles to an Electron installer, which can be installed on a Windows machine.
Produces a runnable executable

### Server
Current state: runnable javascript with node.js.

## Future plans
Migrate client to web-only (platform independent)
Maybe optimize server to run on the cloud (like GCP or Firebase?)
